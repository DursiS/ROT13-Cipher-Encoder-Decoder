# ROT13-Cipher-Encoder-Decoder

ROT13 is a substitution Cipher. Hence, it substitutes each letter in a string of text with a different letter.
As-per the name, encoding with the ROT13 Cipher changes each letter 13 positions forward in the alphabet.
Then decoding reverses each letter 13 positions back in the alphabet.
