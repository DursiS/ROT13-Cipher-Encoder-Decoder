The ROT13 Cipher:

Substitutes each letter in a string of text with a different letter.

Keeping anything else but letter as it was.

As-per the name, encoding with the ROT13 Cipher changes each letter 13 positions forward in the alphabet.

Then decoding reverses each letter 13 positions back in the alphabet.
